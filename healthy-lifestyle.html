    <h1>Healthy lifestyle</h1>

    <h2>Nutrition</h2>
    <p>
    Nutrition is a critical part of health and development.
    Better nutrition is related to improved infant, child and maternal health,
    stronger immune systems, safer pregnancy and childbirth,
    lower risk of non-communicable diseases (such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease), and longevity.</p>

    <h2>Exercise</h2>
    <p>Regular physical activity can improve your muscle strength and boost your endurance.
    Exercise sends oxygen and nutrients to your tissues and helps your cardiovascular system work more efficiently. 
    And when your heart and lung health improve, you have more energy to tackle daily chores.</p>
